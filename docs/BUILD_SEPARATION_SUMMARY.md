# Build Script Separation Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully separated the multi-architecture build process into dedicated scripts for Apple Silicon and Intel architectures.

## Created Scripts

### 1. `build_apple_silicon.sh`
- **Target**: Apple Silicon (arm64) Macs
- **Features**: Full functionality including YAML comment preservation
- **Dependencies**: All dependencies including ruamel.yaml
- **Output**: `EZpanso-1.2.1-AppleSilicon.dmg`

### 2. `build_intel.sh`  
- **Target**: Intel (x86_64) Macs
- **Features**: Core functionality without comment preservation
- **Dependencies**: Basic PyQt6 and pure Python PyYAML (no compiled extensions)
- **Output**: `EZpanso-1.2.1-Intel.dmg`
- **Limitations**: Cannot preserve YAML comments due to cross-compilation constraints

## Key Changes Made

### Build Scripts
- Created separate, focused build scripts for each architecture
- Added clear warnings about Intel build limitations
- Improved dependency management for cross-compilation

### Spec Files Updated
- **EZpanso-intel.spec**: Removed ruamel.yaml dependencies, added comments about limitations
- **EZpanso-arm64.spec**: Added comments about full functionality

### README.md Updates
- Added detailed section about architecture-specific limitations
- Explained why Intel builds cannot preserve YAML comments
- Updated build instructions to reflect separate scripts
- Added clear warnings for users about feature differences

## Technical Issues Resolved

### Cross-Compilation Problem
- **Issue**: ARM64-compiled extensions (ruamel.yaml, PyYAML C extensions) cannot be used in x86_64 builds
- **Solution**: Use pure Python implementations for Intel builds
- **Trade-off**: Intel builds lose YAML comment preservation feature

### Dependency Management
- Explicitly uninstall problematic packages before Intel builds
- Force reinstall with pure Python versions using `--no-binary` flag
- Maintain full dependency set for Apple Silicon builds

## User Impact

### Apple Silicon Users
- Full functionality maintained
- YAML comment preservation works normally
- No limitations

### Intel Users  
- Core functionality available
- **Important**: YAML comments will not be preserved
- Application will display architecture in preferences
- Users informed about limitations in documentation

## File Structure
```
├── build_apple_silicon.sh  (New - Apple Silicon only)
├── build_intel.sh          (New - Intel only)  
├── build_multi_arch.sh     (Deprecated - use individual scripts)
├── EZpanso-arm64.spec      (Updated with comments)
├── EZpanso-intel.spec      (Updated - removed ruamel.yaml)
└── README.md               (Updated with architecture info)
```

## Current Status
✅ Intel DMG successfully created: `EZpanso-1.2.1-Intel.dmg` (19.3 MB)
✅ All documentation updated with limitation notices
✅ Users will be clearly informed about architectural differences

The separation is complete and both architectures can now be built independently with appropriate feature sets.
